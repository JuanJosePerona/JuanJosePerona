### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Juan.
#### I'm an advanced student of Electrical Engineering who's giving a shot to development.
I'm from CÃ³rdoba - Argentina, moving to Spain soon.
I'm currently learning languages and frameworks of FrontEnd to be as qualified as possible.
I've worked for public administration for 10 years, and I think it's time to change.

Skills: HTML / CSS / PYTHON
